# 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier from Scratch

This project is a pure Python implementation of a **Decision Tree Classifier** built from scratch using only **NumPy** and **Pandas**, without relying on libraries like `scikit-learn`. It supports training, prediction, accuracy evaluation, feature importance, and a custom visualization of the tree structure.

## 🚀 Features

- Build a decision tree using Gini impurity
- Predict labels for test data
- Calculate model accuracy
- Extract and plot feature importances
- Visualize the decision tree structure
- CLI-friendly modular design

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Recursively finds the best split using Gini Index.
2. Builds a tree of decision and leaf nodes.
3. Predicts by traversing the tree for each input.
4. Supports export and visualization of the tree structure.

## 📊 Visualization

The tree is visualized using Matplotlib with nodes grouped by depth. Leaf nodes are marked with class labels, while decision nodes show splitting conditions
